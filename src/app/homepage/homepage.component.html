              A general ambulance is a medically equipped vehicle which transports patients to treatment
              facilities, such as hospitals. Typically, out-of-hospital medical
              care is provided to the patient during the transport. Ambulances are
              used to respond to medical emergencies by emergency medical services (EMS)
